# Python Socket

This project simulates a connection between a client and a server. A socket was created using the socket module from Python Standard Library.
The server will accept the data from both clients and respond accordingly to each.
## To Test:
Run server.py in the command line. Must have Python 3.6 install on your computer.
Then, run both client.py and client-2.py to receive a response.


### Expected Output:
The expected output should be 

'Hi' to client.py,
'Goodbye' to client-2.py
